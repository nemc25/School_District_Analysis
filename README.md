# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis:
The school board discovered incorrect test scores in ninth-grade and requested for updated data summaries. Math and reading scores were replaced with "NaN" value, so this challenge is requesting to fix that error and compare the schools to analyze the scoring and type of schools and its spending ranges.

## Results:

In the image above we can see the total scores of math and reading from 15 schools with a total students of 39,170. 
Average math score: 78.9.
Average reading score: 81.9.
% of passing math: 74%.
% of passing reading: 85%.

The image above shows the top 5 schools with best passing scores. It shows that those 5 schools have an overall passing % above 90%.
The top 5 schools also represent an average math score above 83 as well as average reading score. In % passing math is above 93% while % passing reading is above 95.54%. These are also charter schools.

The schools show above represents the botton 5 schools with a very low overal passing percetage of below 54%.
These schools reflect an average math score of above 76, and the average reading score is above 80. The % passing math is above 65% while % passing reading is above 80%. These are district schools

We can evaluate a score difference of approximately 10% between the top 5 schools that are charter type and the botton 5 schools which are district type.

The image below shows that the top scoring students spend less than $584, while students who obtain a lower score spend higher rangers above $600.
